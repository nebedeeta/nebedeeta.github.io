      <description>Introduction Football is the leader sport in 31 out of the 51 countries in Europe and to avoid putative misunderstanding with our American readers, I mean soccer amigos. Europeans express their love for football in various and diverse ways, most of them accompanied with alcohol and flatbread Italian delicacies. But we are not here to judge, we are here to make money (well, try to make money at least).
I hate to admit that this post is not scientifically motivated.</description>
