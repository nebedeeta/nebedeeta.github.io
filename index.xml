Europeans express their love for football in various and diverse ways, most of them accompanied with alcohol and flatbread Italian delicacies.

I hate to admit that this post is not scientifically motivated.</description>

She is believed to be the Goddess of planning, achievement and success in life, hence prayers to her typically end with the formula &amp;ldquo;Bravo Nibedeeta, she had a plan&amp;rdquo;.</description>
